# D.A.I.S.E - Delivery Autonomous Intelligent Sidewalk Explorer

## Introduction
Welcome to the D.A.I.S.E project! This repository contains the complete source code and documentation for building and operating a low-cost delivery robot within a $400 budget. This project aims to demonstrate that effective robotic delivery systems can be developed economically without relying on prebuilt libraries or software.

D.A.I.S.E (Delivery Autonomous Intelligent Sidewalk Explorer) is designed to navigate sidewalks, avoid obstacles, and deliver goods to specified locations using a combination of GPS, LiDAR, camera, and IMU sensors. The project leverages sensor fusion and custom algorithms for path planning, obstacle avoidance, and re-routing.

This project is the first prototype of D.A.I.S.E, built using materials and tools available within our budget constraints. As a prototype, the robot does not carry any payload because our initial focus is testing and validating the software and navigation systems.

As this is a prototype, the outer body was designed using a storage box from a dollar store, and 3D-printed parts were used to attach and support certain components. All the components were arranged and placed with consideration to maintain the center of gravity and ensure stability. This approach allowed us to focus on the functionality and testing of the software while staying within our budget constraints.

## Flowchart

![Daise flowchart 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce58a0d2-4acc-49fe-a863-7bfec431cd85)

### Start:
- The process begins by initializing all system components. This includes setting up the Raspberry Pi, initializing the sensor fusion thread, starting the LiDAR motor, and checking the sensorâ€™s health status.
- The sensor fusion process is initiated in a separate thread to continuously integrate data from multiple sensors (GPS, IMU, LiDAR, Camera).

### User Input:
- After initializing the system components, the user is prompted to input the destination coordinates (latitude and longitude). These coordinates define the robot's final destination.
- The predefined path, loaded from `gps_coordinates.csv`, is used in conjunction with the user-inputted destination to guide the robot.

### Main Control Loop:
- The robot enters the main control loop, which operates continuously until the destination is reached or the process is interrupted.
- In each iteration of the loop:
  - **Fetch Current State**: The robotâ€™s current state (position, velocity, orientation) is fetched from the shared state object, continuously updated by the sensor fusion thread.
  - **Update Visualization**: The real-time visualization plot is updated with the robot's current position to provide visual feedback on its progress.
  - **Read LiDAR Data**: LiDAR data is read to detect obstacles in the robotâ€™s path. If an obstacle is detected, the `handle_obstacle()` function is called to manage the obstacle.

### Obstacle Detection and Handling:

#### LiDAR Obstacle Detection:
- If the LiDAR sensor detects an obstacle:
  - The robot stops immediately.
  - The robot waits for 25 seconds to see if the obstacle clears on its own.
  - If the obstacle persists after 25 seconds, the `calculate_detour_path(scan_data)` function is called to find a path around the obstacle using the A* algorithm.
  - The robot follows the detour path calculated by the A* algorithm.
  - After navigating the obstacle, the robot returns to the predefined path and resumes its journey.

#### Camera Obstacle Detection:
- If an obstacle is detected by the camera:
  - The robot stops immediately.
  - The robot waits for 25 seconds to see if the obstacle clears on its own.
  - If the obstacle persists after 25 seconds, the `calculate_detour_path(obstacle_mask)` function is called to find a path around the obstacle using the A* algorithm.
  - The robot follows the detour path calculated by the A* algorithm.
  - After navigating the obstacle, the robot returns to the predefined path and resumes its journey.

### Path Following:
- The robot uses the carrot-chasing algorithm to follow the predefined path. This involves continuously adjusting its movement based on the lookahead point (carrot) on the path.
- The `find_carrot_index(current_lat, current_lon, path, 5)` function finds the next carrot point on the path.
- The `move_to_carrot(current_lat, current_lon, carrot_lat, carrot_lon)` function calculates the direction and distance to the carrot point and moves the robot accordingly.

### Dynamic Re-Routing:
- If obstacles are encountered, the robot dynamically recalculates the path and follows a detour using the A* algorithm.
- The robot temporarily leaves the predefined path to navigate around the obstacle.
- Once the obstacle is cleared, the robot recalculates its position and re-joins the predefined path to continue toward the destination.

### Completion:
- The process continues iteratively, with the robot fetching its current state, updating the visualization, reading sensor data, and adjusting its path as needed.
- The loop repeats until the robot reaches the final destination as defined by the user-inputted coordinates.
- Once the destination is reached, the flowchart ends, marking the completion of the robot's navigation task.

By following these detailed steps, the D.A.I.S.E. project ensures that the robot can autonomously navigate from its initial position to the final destination, avoiding obstacles and dynamically adjusting its path as needed. This comprehensive process leverages advanced robotics concepts, sensor fusion, and real-time decision-making to achieve efficient and reliable autonomous navigation.
